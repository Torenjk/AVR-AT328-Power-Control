# AVR-AT328-Power-Control
Simple Power Controller for AVR Chips

*NOT PRODUCTION READY!*

Written for AT328 but should run on others too. You only need to check for the Register Adresses.
Compile with avr-gcc.

Todo:
- Change LPCO Operate modes
- Clock Source setup
- ~~external interrupt detection (e.g Port B)~~ (done)
